   - `arm64` for ARM processors
2. **Extract** the archive:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf file.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Run the installer** from the extracted folder:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   - If you forget to use `sudo`, the script will stop and show you the exact command to run (e.g. `sudo ./install.sh`).

4. The installer will:

   - Copy the program to `/usr/local/bin/`
   - Create and start a systemd service named **himawari**
   - Initialize the database (ready to use)
